Thomas Kühn, Kay Bierzynski, Sebastian Richly, Uwe Aßmann

This is the artifact submission corresponding to the SLE'16 tool paper with the above title. It features a virtual machine packed with the ready to use modeling editor FRaMED. FRaMED is a full-fledged role modeling editor allowing the graphical specification of role-based software systems by means of compartments (aka. contexts), objects, roles, and relationships. It is currently maintained and developed as a project on [github](https://github.com/leondart/FRaMED),
however, the artefact corresponds to release [v2.0.3](https://github.com/leondart/FRaMED/releases/tag/v2.0.3).

## Tool Demonstration

Henceforth, we describe and illustrate the installation and usage of \texttt{FRaMED}.

### Installation

First and foremost, we have prepared a **virtual machine** for the virtualization environment `VirtualBox`
that can be installed, as follows:
 * Download and install `VirtualBox` for your platform from their [website](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
 * Download the `FRaMED` virtual machine from this repository or from [http://st.inf.tu-dresden.de/intern/framed/framed-ubuntu.ova] *(1.8~GB)*
 * Open your \texttt{VirtualBox} and \emph{Import} the downloaded file
 * Startup the added \texttt{framed-ubuntu\_1} virtual machine
